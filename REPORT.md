# Report

# This is the report of this tool

This was a big assignment. I've spend a minimum of 4 weeks in total on this project.
The problems I ran into, were first of all, that you had to look everything up before you could even begin.
The cases and modules were new to me, and it took me a couple of days for reading the documentation and 
search online for more information and video's on the subjects.

# Argparse module

Before this assignment I didn't know what argparse was. The video's and documentation were pretty straight forward what i found on the internet
so that wasn't really an issue. It's nice to know that you can do all kinds of things with argparse.
next to this i also make a pizza ordering tool to practice on befor to start whith te project.

# Datetime module

It was difficult to learn about all the strptime and strftime options. With type() I finally managed to
create a working functions of it. 
by some hard looking on the internet for some explaining.

# CSV module

Before this assignment I whas know what a .csv file was. but I didn't know that you could open, write and read files with Python. 
so that whas for me also a hard learning for me. 

# Table module

This is where it got interesting. I couldn't find good documentation how to simply add nice looking tables in the CLI. Only after explanation from some youtube video,s, I finally managed to add some nice tables.

# Advance time module

my program should have an internal conception of what day it is -- perhaps saved to a simple text file -- that we can advance time by two days by using a command like
so i whent to the exstream whit this now you have to put the day in it how many you whant.


# Endless possibilities

I also had a hard time with all the different usecases in which you have to account for in your application. Number of things could go wrong, so I had to think of a lot of possibilities what could go wrong.
Let's just say that I learnt a lot last couple of weeks. 
It was a good exercise.
i also understand now how importent this is to learn about it.
