Report
Please include a short, 300-word report that highlights three technical elements of your implementation that you find notable, explain what problem they solve and why you chose to implement it in this way. Include this in your repository as a report.md file.

You may use Markdown for your report, but it is not required.
To assist your explanation you may use code snippets.
